# unbiasedMoments
Unbiased moment estimates - general order

Generate unbiased estimates of central moments of an arbitrary order (the Jupyter notebook provides estimates up to the sixth order). Includes estimates of products and powers of moments - such as _(mu_2*mu_3)_ or *(mu_2^3)*, where *mu_2* and *mu_3* are the second and the third central moments of the distribution.
