# unbiasedMoments
Unbiased moment estimators - general order

Generate unbiased estimators of central moments of an arbitrary order (the Jupyter notebook provides estimates up to the sixth order). Includes estimates of products and powers of moments - such as _(mu_2*mu_3)_ or *(mu_2^3)*, where *mu_2* and *mu_3* are the second and the third central moments of the distribution.

For two-sample pooled estimates, results are produced up to the 6th order as well; 6th order expressions are too long to be included in the file and can be generated by running the code (either in Jupyter or Sage), which will write the results in separate files.
